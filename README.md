# ContainerViewAdjustableContentLayout
If your view layout is done programmatically, this class will help overcome difficulties in view debugging and inefficiency in achieving the desired view layout. Using this as your superclass for containers allows layout debugging and free adjustability of subview layout during runtime.

Example screen on iPad using simple wrapper around UITableViewCell contentView:
<img src="delta-overlay.png" alt="Example Screen" style="width:200px;"/>
